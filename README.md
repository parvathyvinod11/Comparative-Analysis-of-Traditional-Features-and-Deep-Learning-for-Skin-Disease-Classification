Comparative Analysis of Traditional Features and Deep Learning for Skin Disease Classification
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores skin disease classification using the ISIC-2019 dataset, comparing:

Traditional handcrafted feature extraction methods (HOG, LBP, Edge detection)

Deep learning approaches (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet)

The goal is to analyze accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and trade-offs between these techniques in medical image classification.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset

We used the ISIC-2019 dataset, containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 8 clinically relevant categories:

Actinic Keratosis

Basal Cell Carcinoma

Benign Keratosis

Dermatofibroma

Melanocytic Nevus

Melanoma

Squamous Cell Carcinoma

Vascular Lesions
