**Comparative Analysis of Traditional Features and Deep Learning for Skin Disease Classification**


ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**

This project explores skin disease classification using the ISIC-2019 dataset, comparing:

1. Traditional handcrafted feature extraction methods (HOG, LBP, Edge detection)

2. Deep learning approaches (ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet)

3. The goal is to analyze accuracy, robustness, interpretability, and trade-offs between these techniques in medical image classification.


ðŸ“‚ **Dataset**


We used the ISIC-2019 dataset, containing 25,331 dermoscopic images across 8 clinically relevant categories:

1. Actinic Keratosis

2. Basal Cell Carcinoma

3. Benign Keratosis

4. Dermatofibroma

5. Melanocytic Nevus

6. Melanoma

7. Squamous Cell Carcinoma

8. Vascular Lesions

ðŸ›   **Methodology**


ðŸ”¹ Traditional Feature Extraction 

Preprocessing: Grayscale conversion, resizing (128Ã—128), normalization

Techniques:

a) Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

b) Local Binary Patterns (LBP)

c) Edge Features (Canny-based)

d) Classifiers: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest

e) Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC, Cohenâ€™s Kappa, robustness under noise & perturbations

ðŸ”¹ Deep Learning Approach

a) Base Models: Pretrained ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNet (transfer learning)

b) Preprocessing: Resize (224Ã—224), normalization, augmentation (rotation, flips, zoom, contrast, Gaussian noise)

c) Architecture:

Frozen CNN backbone (ResNet50)

Global Average Pooling

Dense + Dropout layers

Softmax output (8 classes)

d) Training: Adam optimizer, Categorical Cross-Entropy, Early Stopping, ModelCheckpoint

e) Evaluation: Confusion Matrix, ROCâ€“AUC, Cohenâ€™s Kappa, Precision-Recall curves, Top-K accuracy, saliency maps

ðŸ“Š  **Results**

Traditional Methods

Best Accuracy: 55% (HOG + Random Forest)

Best Fairness: HOG + KNN (Macro-F1 â‰ˆ 0.22)

Robustness: HOG + Decision Tree most stable under noise

**Deep Learning (ResNet50)**

Test Accuracy: 66%

ROCâ€“AUC: Micro = 0.94 | Macro = 0.88

Best Class Performance: Melanocytic Nevus (F1 = 0.82)

Challenges: Poor performance on minority classes (Dermatofibroma, Vascular Lesions)

ðŸ“Œ  **Key Insights**

âœ… Traditional methods â†’ Lightweight, interpretable, resource-friendly, but limited with complex lesion patterns.

âœ… Deep learning methods â†’ Higher accuracy & generalization, but require GPUs and large datasets.

âœ… Hybrid approaches â†’ Combining handcrafted + deep features improves robustness & interpretability.
